# EP-001 — Author can create and edit rich Markdown documents with Pandoc extended syntax

## Outcome

The author edits documents in a GUI that supports Pandoc extended Markdown. Output is valid Pandoc Markdown; round-trip editing preserves structure. The editor produces what Pandoc can convert to PDF and DOCX.

## Scope

- TipTap editor with custom node types for Pandoc fenced divs (callout, executive-summary, recommendation)
- Support for: headings (H1–H6), lists (ordered, unordered, nested), tables, blockquotes, footnotes
- YAML frontmatter for document metadata
- Character formatting: bold, italic (minimum viable set)
- Documents persist as Pandoc Markdown files with YAML frontmatter

## Non-scope (Phase 0)

- Citations/bibliography (Phase 2)
- Clause library
- Collaboration

## Success Criteria

- Author can create a document with headings, lists, tables, fenced divs, and frontmatter
- Saved file is valid Pandoc Markdown; Pandoc can process it
- Round-trip: edit → save → reload preserves structure
