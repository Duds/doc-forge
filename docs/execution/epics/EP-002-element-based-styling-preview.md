# EP-002 — Author can apply element-based styling and preview print output

## Outcome

The author sees a print preview that approximates final PDF appearance. Styling follows the element-based model: Pandoc elements (h1–h6, p, ul, ol, blockquote, table, figure, figcaption) plus custom semantic div classes (callout, executive-summary). Multi-level heading numbering via CSS counters.

## Scope

- Print stylesheet (CSS) covering all Pandoc structural elements
- Word-style styling: apply style = apply element/class; style definitions in CSS
- Print preview in editor (WYSIWYG or near-WYSIWYG)
- CSS counters for hierarchical heading numbering (1, 1.1, 2.2.1)
- Author-configurable stylesheet path

## Non-scope (Phase 0)

- Brand manifest (Phase 2)
- In-editor style customisation UI (Phase 0: author edits CSS file directly)

## Success Criteria

- Author loads a stylesheet; editor preview reflects it
- Headings, lists, tables, blockquotes, fenced divs render with correct structure
- Heading numbering (1, 1.1, 2.2.1) works when enabled in CSS
