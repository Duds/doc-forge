# EP-004 — Author can export documents to professional PDF and DOCX without post-processing

## Outcome

The author exports the current document to PDF and DOCX with one click. Output is professional quality for the author's use case; no manual post-processing required. Pandoc performs the conversion; the author's print stylesheet and optional reference DOCX template control appearance.

## Scope

- One-click PDF export via Pandoc CLI
- One-click DOCX export via Pandoc CLI
- Author-configured print stylesheet (CSS) for PDF
- Optional reference DOCX template for DOCX styling
- pandoc-crossref or equivalent for captions and cross-references (if needed for Phase 0)
- Export to deliverables/ or user-chosen path

## Non-scope (Phase 0)

- PPTX export (Phase 1)
- Track-changes-compatible DOCX (Phase 2)

## Success Criteria

- Export completes in under 30 seconds for documents up to 50 pages
- PDF and DOCX output is acceptable for the author's client deliverables without manual fixing
- Stylesheet and reference DOCX are applied correctly
