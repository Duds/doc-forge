# US-050 — Launch DocForge as desktop app

**As an** author,  
**I want to** launch DocForge as a desktop app  
**so that** I can use it like a native tool.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] I can launch the application from the OS (double-click or command)
- [ ] The app opens with the editor UI
- [ ] I can create or open a project
- [ ] Core workflow (edit, save, export) works without network
- [ ] App runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux (or at least one platform for Phase 0)
