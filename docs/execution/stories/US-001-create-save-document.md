# US-001 — Create and save new document

**As an** author,  
**I want to** create and save a new document  
**so that** I can start from scratch within a project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The document opens in the editor with empty content and default frontmatter
- [ ] I can edit content and save; file is written to the project folder (working/ or deliverables/)
- [ ] Saved file is valid Pandoc Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] I can reopen the document and content is preserved
