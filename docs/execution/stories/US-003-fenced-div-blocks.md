# US-003 — Add fenced div blocks (callout, executive-summary)

**As an** author,  
**I want to** add fenced div blocks (callout, executive-summary)  
**so that** I can use semantic structure for professional documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] I can insert a callout block via toolbar or menu
- [ ] I can insert an executive-summary block
- [ ] Blocks render with distinct styling in the editor
- [ ] Saved output is valid Pandoc fenced div syntax (e.g. `::: callout`)
- [ ] Blocks can contain paragraphs, lists, and other inline content
