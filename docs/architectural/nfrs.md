# Non-Functional Requirements

> **Status:** Stub — to be developed alongside PRD.

## Categories to Address

- Performance (document load, AI response, export generation times)
- Scalability (document size limits, concurrent users)
- Reliability and availability
- Security (data at rest, in transit, AI data handling, multi-tenancy)
- Privacy (document content privacy, LLM provider data policies)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum for the editor UI; PDF/UA for exports)
- Internationalisation and localisation
- Compliance (Australian Privacy Act, government ISM/IRAP where applicable)
- Portability (export fidelity, format openness)
- Maintainability and extensibility
