risks:
  - id: R-001
    risk: "DOCX/PPTX export fidelity insufficient for professional use (manual correction required)"
    likelihood: High
    impact: Critical
    mitigation: "Technical spike against Engagement Letter, Board Paper, Cabinet Submission before customer commitment; validate with selected export library"

  - id: R-002
    risk: "LLM hallucination in clause-adjacent or variable content"
    likelihood: Medium
    impact: High
    mitigation: "Deterministic clause insertion only; human confirmation for all AI-generated content; AI scoped to variable zones only"

  - id: R-003
    risk: "Behaviour change resistance — users revert to ad hoc formatting"
    likelihood: Low
    impact: Low
    mitigation: "Phase 1+ risk; primary user is also designer in Phase 0, so resistance is minimal. For Phase 1+: template-first UX; style picker primary; character formatting behind friction notice"

  - id: R-004
    risk: "Microsoft adds competing AI-native document mode to Word"
    likelihood: Medium
    impact: High
    mitigation: "Accelerate time to market; deepen vertical integration and compliance story; InDesign positioning (authoring vs distribution)"

  - id: R-005
    risk: "Government procurement delayed by security certification (ISM, IRAP)"
    likelihood: High
    impact: Medium
    mitigation: "Phase 2 risk; not relevant to Phase 0 or Phase 1. Complete ADR for LLM provider and data sovereignty before government engagement; plan certification into roadmap"

  - id: R-006
    risk: "Clause library onboarding friction slows initial sales"
    likelihood: Medium
    impact: Medium
    mitigation: "Validate with 1–2 target accounts; define pricing and partner model before go-to-market"

  - id: R-007
    risk: "Pandoc export fidelity insufficient — print stylesheet and reference DOCX may not produce professional output without significant investment"
    likelihood: Medium
    impact: High
    mitigation: "Invest in CSS and reference DOCX template; validate against representative document types before Phase 0 completion"
    owner: TBD
    status: Open
    date_added: "2026-02-20"
  - id: R-008
    risk: "GUI complexity for Pandoc semantic blocks — rendering fenced divs (e.g. :::callout) as WYSIWYG nodes in TipTap requires custom node types; non-trivial"
    likelihood: Medium
    impact: High
    mitigation: "Technical spike on TipTap custom nodes for Pandoc fenced divs; consider progressive enhancement (raw block initially) if full WYSIWYG is deferred"
