# Backlog Management

**DocForge** uses a documentation-led artefact hierarchy. Execution artefacts (backlog, epics, stories) align with strategic and conceptual documents.

## Hierarchy of Truth

1. **Strategic** — `docs/strategic/` (problem-statement, solution-concept, options-analysis, business-case, benefits-map)
2. **Conceptual** — `docs/conceptual/` (conops, prd-lean)
3. **Architectural** — `docs/architectural/` (principles, hla, adrs, nfrs, security-data)
4. **Planning** — `docs/planning/` (operating-model, roadmap, release-plan)
5. **Execution** — `docs/execution/` (backlog, epics, stories)
6. **Governance** — `docs/governance/` (RAIDD, gate-packs, change-control, benefits-tracking)

When prioritising work, use the roadmap and PRD; the backlog reflects prioritised execution items derived from them.

## Backlog and Epic/Story Structure

- **Backlog** — `docs/execution/backlog.md`: master index of epics with ID, title, status; links to epics and stories directories.
- **Epics** — `docs/execution/epics/`: one file per epic (e.g. `EP-NNN-title.md`). Outcome-oriented titles (e.g. "Users can create brand-compliant documents from templates"), not feature-oriented ("Template system").
- **Stories** — `docs/execution/stories/`: one file per user story (e.g. `US-NNN-title.md`). Format: *As a [persona], I want [capability] so that [outcome].* Acceptance criteria must be testable.

## Lifecycle

- **Creation**: When roadmap or PRD work is ready for execution, add or update epics in `backlog.md` and create or update epic/story files in `epics/` and `stories/`.
- **Naming**: Epics `EP-NNN-[kebab-case].md`; stories `US-NNN-[kebab-case].md`.
- **Completion**: Update `status` in the epic or story file and in `backlog.md` when work is done.

## Agent Workflow

When starting an execution task:

1. Check `docs/planning/roadmap.md` and `docs/conceptual/prd-lean.md` for priority and scope.
2. Read `docs/execution/backlog.md` and the relevant epic file in `docs/execution/epics/`.
3. Use story acceptance criteria as the basis for verification.
4. Update status in the story/epic file and in `backlog.md` when complete.

For content standards (outcome-oriented epics, story format, acceptance criteria), follow the docforge-drafter skill: `skills/docforge-drafter/SKILL.md`.
