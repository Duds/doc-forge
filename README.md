# DocForge

> **Working title.** Branding TBD.

An AI-native, semantically structured document creation platform. DocForge is designed as a professional alternative to Word and PowerPoint that treats documents as structured data first, with a familiar GUI rendering layer on top. Every document is simultaneously human-readable, brand-renderable, and LLM-consumable — with no conversion step between those states.

## Concept Summary

DocForge addresses a structural gap in the business document tooling market: the absence of a document creation environment that is simultaneously:

- **Semantically structured** — documents carry meaning, not just appearance
- **AI-native** — the storage format is the AI exchange format; no translation layer
- **Brand-compliant by default** — style is a theme concern, not a document concern
- **Professionally capable** — full feature parity with Word/PowerPoint for business use cases
- **LLM-generatable and LLM-consumable** — every document is a valid AI input and output

The target market is professional services firms, government agencies, and any organisation producing high-volume structured documents with brand compliance requirements.

## Quick Start

- **[TODO](TODO.md)** — Immediate tasks and Phase 0 checklist
- **[Backlog](docs/execution/backlog.md)** — Epics and stories (Phase 0: 6 epics, 20+ stories)
